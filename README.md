# odin-recipes
The current project is about getting used to the very basic HTML tools:
HTML boilerplate or basic Document format
anchors
lists
image embedding
hyperlinks

This project consists of a very basic webpage consisting of a set of hyperlinks to recipes.
Although Im already initiated with some dev tools, this is my first time using Git & Github.
This assignment is part of The Odin Project. I will revisit it later on when learning about CSS.
